                Human migrants may or may not abandon the sending systems, e.g., land and other resources, and occupy the
                receiving systems, e.g., for jobs. The resource consumption also shifts from sending to receiving systems,
                influencing sustainability in both systems. Effects on sustainability in spillover systems may vary depending on
                their relationships with sending and receiving systems.
