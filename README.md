Telecoupling is a novel interdisciplinary umbrella concept that enables natural and social scientists to understand and generate information for managing how humans and nature can sustainably coexist worldwide. 
The telecoupling framework gains its distinction by enabling researchers to dive deeply into systemic complexities, even if systems are far away from each other. 
It is also ambitious in its aim to meet challenges unencumbered by disciplines. To understand the forces affecting sustainability across local to global scales, it is essential to build a comprehensive set of spatially explicit tools for describing and quantifying multiple reciprocal socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances. 
Here we introduce the Telecoupling Toolbox, the first suite of software tools developed to map and identify the five major interrelated components of the telecoupling framework: systems, flows, agents, causes, and effects. 
The modular design of the toolbox allows the integration of existing tools and software to assess synergies and tradeoffs associated with policies and other local to global interventions.
It is our hope that the innovative, free and open-source toolbox can provide a useful platform to address globally important issues, such as land use and land cover change, species invasion, migration, flows of ecosystem services, and trade of goods and products.
