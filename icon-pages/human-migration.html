                Human migrants may abandon sending systems, including land and other resources within the sending system, 
                and occupy receiving systems for a multitude of reasons, including safety and economic opportunity. 
                The resource consumption also shifts from sending to receiving systems,
                influencing sustainability in both systems. Effects on sustainability in spillover systems may vary depending on
                their relationships with sending and receiving systems.
