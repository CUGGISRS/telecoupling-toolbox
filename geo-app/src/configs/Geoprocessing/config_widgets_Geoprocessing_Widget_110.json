{"name":"NetworkAnalysisGrouping","displayName":"Network Analysis Grouping","description":"This tool uses network information (i.e. nodes, links, and directions) of units (e.g. countries, areas, administrative units) within a telecoupling system and aggregates them into groups (clusters) based on their network connectivity. Upon successfully completing execution, the tool will automatically export a new shapefile of the telecoupling system along with their grouping outcomes (cluster number) added in attribute table for each of the clustered unit. Optionally, the tool can generate an output plot (in PDF format) showing the clustering outcome of the network analysis. Examples of network data are migration of population (e.g. immigration, tourists, business travelers, students and etc.) or import/export of goods.","category":"","helpUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/directories/arcgisoutput/Geoprocessing/NetworkAnalysisGrouping_GPServer/Geoprocessing_NetworkAnalysisGrouping/NetworkAnalysisGrouping.htm","serverInfo":{"currentVersion":10.41,"url":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/NetworkAnalysisGrouping/GPServer/","hasResultMapServer":true,"resultMapServerName":"Geoprocessing/NetworkAnalysisGrouping","supportsUpload":true,"maxUploadFileSize":2000},"useResultMapServer":true,"taskUrl":"https://lb.telecoupling.msu.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Geoprocessing/NetworkAnalysisGrouping/GPServer/Network Analysis Grouping","isSynchronous":false,"inputParams":[{"name":"Nodes_Table","dataType":"GPDataFile","description":"Input .csv file containing a list of all the telecoupling systems (e.g. countries, administrative units) that are to be considered as \"nodes\" in the network grouping analysis.

In this model, each node can be in one of c spin states, and the edges specify which pairs of nodes would prefer to stay in the same spin state and which ones prefer to have different spin states. Communities can be defined according to the spin states of nodes after running the model.NOTE: Refer to R igraph package help page for more information about the algorithms. http://igraph.org/r/doc/communities.html","defaultValue":"walktrap","category":"","choiceList":["walktrap","spin_glass"],"label":"Clustering Algorithm","visible":true,"required":true,"tooltip":"Clustering Algorithm"},{"name":"Weight_Within_Clusters","dataType":"GPDouble","description":"Input number to ajust the distance between nodes within a cluster.","defaultValue":10,"category":"Plotting Options","label":"Weight Within Clusters","visible":true,"required":false,"tooltip":"Weight Within Clusters"},{"name":"Weight_Between_Clusters","dataType":"GPDouble","description":"Input number to ajust the distance between nodes between different clusters.","defaultValue":2,"category":"Plotting Options","label":"Weight Between Clusters","visible":true,"required":false,"tooltip":"Weight Between Clusters"},{"name":"Color_Set","dataType":"GPString","description":"To select color sets for different clusters.
